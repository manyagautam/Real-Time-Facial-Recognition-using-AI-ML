Real-Time Facial Recognition using AI/ML

📌 Overview

This project demonstrates a real-time facial recognition system using AI/ML. It captures live video, detects faces, and recognizes identities using a TensorFlow-based model built on the VGG16 architecture.

🎯 Features

- Real-time image capture using OpenCV.
- Face detection and recognition via deep learning.
- Model optimized for fast inference with GPU support.
- Modular design for training and testing.

🛠️ Tech Stack

- Programming Language: Python
- Frameworks/Libraries: TensorFlow, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib
- Model Architecture: VGG16

🚀 Installation and Usage

Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or later
- Required libraries include TensorFlow, OpenCV, and Matplotlib.
Steps to Run
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Capture images, train the model, and perform real-time recognition.

📂 Project Structure

The project includes directories for data storage, scripts for data collection and model training, and saved models for recognition tasks.

📖 How It Works

1. Data Collection: Captures images via webcam and saves them for training.
2. Model Training: Trains a facial recognition model using VGG16 for feature extraction.
3. Real-Time Recognition: Identifies faces from the live webcam feed and matches them with known identities.

📚 Future Improvements

- Add support for larger datasets.
- Implement more advanced face matching algorithms (e.g., FaceNet).
- Enhance accuracy for diverse lighting and angles.
